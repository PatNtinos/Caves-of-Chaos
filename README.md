# Caves-of-Chaos

Î‘ fun roguelike that will give you a small break from your troubles... or not? Up for the challenge?

**Caves of Chaos** is a Java roguelike dungeon crawler, where you have to descend 10 Treacherous levels and finally face the Serpent of Chaos. On your quest for the Luminous Diamond, youâ€™ll battle hordes of enemies, gather powerful loot, and grow stronger with each step.... if you survive. Forged in Java (Swing) as part of my Masterâ€™s OOP course, with playfulness.


In this game, the player chooses their preferred class, Wizard or Warrior, waits a moment for the dungeon to awaken and begins his adventure... again. He is welcomed by a muddy cave, shrouded in darkness. As the Hero ventures through the dark corners of the caves, he faces various enemies, shaped by countless moons of hunger, these creatures thirst for human flesh.

As the players slashes through the hordes while taking occasional naps to regain strength, the player discover ladders that lead to even more chaotic levels. Along the way , he uncovers glorious loot, vital potions and sneaky traps. 

At the final level, the Hero comes face to face with the Serpent of Chaos. Only by slashing through this fearsome beast, he will claim the Legendary Diamond and hear  the trumpets of Victory.
